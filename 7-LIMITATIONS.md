# Limitations & Roadmap

Current limitations, known issues, and future development plans for AccountaPod MVP.

## Current Limitations

### Data Persistence

**Mock Data Implementation**
- **Issue**: All user data is stored in browser memory and resets on page refresh
- **Impact**: Users lose all progress when closing the browser
- **Workaround**: Use session persistence for development testing
- **Timeline**: Full database integration planned for v0.2

**Authentication vs Data Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Supabase handles authentication, but user profiles use mock data
- **Impact**: Real authentication with placeholder user information
- **Workaround**: Consistent mock user profiles for testing
- **Timeline**: User profile integration in v0.2

### Database Schema

**Minimal Schema Implementation**
- **Current**: Only `profiles` table exists in Supabase
- **Missing**: Goals, milestones, pods, check-ins tables
- **Impact**: Cannot persist any application data to database
- **Timeline**: Complete schema migration in v0.2

**No Real-time Synchronization**
- **Issue**: Changes don't sync across browser sessions or devices
- **Impact**: No collaborative features work in real-time
- **Timeline**: Real-time features in v0.3

### Feature Limitations

**Pod Management**
- **Missing**: Creating new pods
- **Missing**: Inviting members to pods
- **Missing**: Pod settings management beyond mock data
- **Timeline**: Full pod management in v0.2

**Goal Categories**
- **Current**: Only "life" and "work" goal types
- **Missing**: Custom categories, tags, or goal organization
- **Timeline**: Enhanced categorization in v0.3

**Milestone Scheduling**
- **Issue**: Milestones are manually assigned to week numbers
- **Missing**: Calendar integration, smart scheduling
- **Timeline**: Calendar features in v0.4

**Check-in Workflow**
- **Current**: Basic check-in form structure
- **Missing**: Structured weekly prompts, reflection templates
- **Missing**: Check-in history and analytics
- **Timeline**: Enhanced check-ins in v0.3

**Analytics & Progress**
- **Current**: Basic progress bars and completion tracking
- **Missing**: Historical trends, goal success rates, pod comparisons
- **Timeline**: Advanced analytics in v0.4

### User Experience Limitations

**Onboarding**
- **Missing**: User onboarding flow for new accounts
- **Missing**: Pod discovery and joining process
- **Impact**: New users see empty states
- **Timeline**: Onboarding flow in v0.2

**Mobile Experience**
- **Current**: Responsive design implemented
- **Limitation**: Not optimized for mobile interaction patterns
- **Missing**: Touch gestures, mobile-specific UI patterns
- **Timeline**: Mobile optimization in v0.3

**Accessibility**
- **Current**: Basic semantic HTML structure
- **Missing**: Full ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Missing**: Screen reader optimization
- **Timeline**: Accessibility audit and improvements in v0.3

### Technical Limitations

**Error Handling**
- **Current**: Basic error states in components
- **Missing**: Global error boundary, retry mechanisms
- **Missing**: Offline handling and error recovery
- **Timeline**: Robust error handling in v0.3

**Performance**
- **Current**: Good for MVP scale (mock data)
- **Limitation**: No pagination, infinite scroll, or data virtualization
- **Impact**: Will not scale to large datasets
- **Timeline**: Performance optimization in v0.4

**Testing**
- **Missing**: Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests
- **Impact**: No automated quality assurance
- **Risk**: Regression bugs during development
- **Timeline**: Testing framework in v0.2

**Security**
- **Current**: Basic Supabase authentication
- **Missing**: Input validation, XSS protection
- **Missing**: Rate limiting, abuse prevention
- **Timeline**: Security audit in v0.3

## Known Issues

### Authentication
- **Issue**: Signup form doesn't create actual accounts (redirects to login)
- **Workaround**: Use Supabase dashboard to create test accounts
- **Status**: Will be fixed with full auth integration

### Navigation
- **Issue**: Dashboard page shows in navigation but displays Goals content
- **Status**: Navigation routing needs cleanup

### Data Consistency
- **Issue**: Mock data relationships not always consistent
- **Example**: Milestones may reference non-existent goals
- **Impact**: Possible UI errors in edge cases

### Browser Compatibility
- **Issue**: Limited testing across browsers and devices
- **Current**: Primarily tested on Chrome/macOS
- **Missing**: Comprehensive cross-browser testing
